♦ Answer from Meta:

Excellent sentence to start with! Let's break it down and create a vocabulary table to help you with the translation.
Vocabulary Table
Sanskrit	English
क्रेता (kretā)	Customer
मापयति (māpayati)	Measures
प्रयत्नः (prayatnaḥ)	Effort
परिणामः (pariṇāmaḥ)	Result/Delivery
Now, let's think about the sentence structure. We can start with the subject "क्रेता" (customer). Then, we'll need to use a verb to describe the action of measuring. We can use "मापयति" (measures) in a negative form to convey "don't measure".
For the second part of the sentence, we'll need to use a verb to describe the action of delivering. We can use a verb that means "to give" or "to provide". Think about a verb that can convey this meaning.
Here's a possible sentence structure to get you started:
क्रेता ... मापयति ... परिणामः ...
Your turn! What verb will you use to describe the action of delivering?
