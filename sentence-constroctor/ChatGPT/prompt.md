Sentence Structure (Possible Approach)
Subject – "Design in the absence of content"
Predicate – "is not design, it's decoration"
Since Sanskrit follows SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) structure, we should aim to structure the sentence accordingly.

Vocabulary Table
Sanskrit	English

Clues to Construct the Sentence

"Design in the absence of content" → Use "absence" (अभाव) and "content" (विषय) properly in genitive or locative case.
"Is not design" → Negate the verb properly (न + अस्ति).
"It's decoration" → Use अस्ति (asti) correctly with decoration (अलङ्कार).
